However, the data (described more in the next section) lends itself to investigate broader questions of equity by demographics and neighborhood across NYC. We also have flexibility in the time range to investigate and may look at longer trends. 2.2 Data availability NYC Open Data (NYC Office of Technology and Innovation (OTI)) in conjunction with New York City Police Department (NYPD) makes public safety data available for anyone online. In particular they publish Complaint Data which contains felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to the NYPD from 2006 till present. Year-to-Date (YTD): https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Current-Year-To-Date-/5uac-w243 Historic: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i 2.2.1 Content “Complaint data” is a mixed set of records because it contains crimes (ex. robbery, rape, assault), parking violations, complaints of harassment, reports of abandoned animals, and more. We will need to investigate, clean, and filter the data to answer our research questions. As the links above indicate, there are two sets of data containing distinct records. A year-to-date dataset from 1/1/2022 to 9/30/2022 and a historic dataset containing records from 1/1/2006 to 12/31/2021. We plan to start with the year-to-date data and potentially incorporate historic records as needed. The dataset contains mostly categorical variables and dates with each row indicating a crime/violation. As of the last update on October 19, 2022, the YTD Dataset contains 397K rows and 36 columns. A data dictionary is provided by NYC Open Data at the link above. Column names and description: S.No Column Name (Data Type): Description CMPLNT_NUM (text): Randomly generated persistent ID for each complaint ADDR_PCT_CD (text): The precinct in which the incident occurred BORO_NM (text): The name of the borough in which the incident occurred CMPLNT_FR_DT (DateTime): Exact date of occurrence for the reported event (or starting date of occurrence, if CMPLNT_TO_DT exists) CMPLNT_FR_TM (text): Exact time of occurrence for the reported event (or starting time of occurrence, if CMPLNT_TO_TM exists) CMPLNT_TO_DT (DateTime): Ending date of occurrence for the reported event, if exact time of occurrence is unknown CMPLNT_TO_TM (text): Ending time of occurrence for the reported event, if exact time of occurrence is unknown CRM_ATPT_CPTD_CD (text): Indicator of whether crime was successfully completed or attempted, but failed or was interrupted prematurely HADEVELOPT (text): Name of NYCHA housing development of occurrence, if applicable HOUSING_PSA (Number): Development Level CodeNumber JURISDICTION_CODE (Number): Jurisdiction responsible for incident. Either internal, like Police(0), Transit(1), and Housing(2); or external(3), like Correction, Port Authority, etc. JURIS_DESC (text): Description of the jurisdiction code KY_CD (Number): Three digit offense classification code LAW_CAT_CD (text): Level of offense: felony, misdemeanor, violation LOC_OF_OCCUR_DESC (text): Specific location of occurrence in or around the premises; inside, opposite of, front of, rear of OFNS_DESC (text): Description of offense corresponding with key code PARKS_NM (text): Name of NYC park, playground or greenspace of occurrence, if applicable (state parks are not included) PATROL_BORO (text): The name of the patrol borough in which the incident occurred PD_CD (Number): Three digit internal classification code (more granular than Key Code) PD_DESC (text): Description of internal classification corresponding with PD code (more granular than Offense Description) PREM_TYP_DESC (text): Specific description of premises; grocery store, residence, street, etc. RPT_DT (DateTime): Date event was reported to police STATION_NAME (text): Transit station name SUSP_AGE_GROUP (text): Suspect’s Age Group SUSP_RACE (text): Suspect’s Race Description SUSP_SEX (text): Suspect’s Sex Description TRANSIT_DISTRICT (Number): Transit district in which the offense occurred VIC_AGE_GROUP (text): Victim’s Age Group VIC_RACE (text): Victim’s Race Description VIC_SEX (text): Victim’s Sex Description X_COORD_CD (Number): X-coordinate for New York State Plane Coordinate System, Long Island Zone, NAD 83, units feet (FIPS 3104) Y_COORD_CD (Number): Y-coordinate for New York State Plane Coordinate System, Long Island Zone, NAD 83, units feet (FIPS 3104) Latitude (Number): Midblock Latitude coordinate for Global Coordinate System, WGS 1984, decimal degrees (EPSG 4326) Longitude (Number): Midblock Longitude coordinate for Global Coordinate System, WGS 1984, decimal degrees (EPSG 4326) LatLon (Location) New Georeferenced Column (Point) 2.2.2 Who Collects The Data The data was collected and published by the NY Police Department (NYPD). 2.2.3 Format and Importation OTI provides the data in 4 formats: 1) online table, 2) visualization, 3) CSV, and 4) API. The first two have limited functionality and customization so we will not use those versions. The API requires an account and authentication tokens. Given that the CSV for YTD data is not too large (140MB), it seems the easiest to work with. CSV is a format we are most familiar with and one that R handles well. Is there a difference between CSV and API? Yes. Not in number of observations but in the columns. With the CSV, we get a total of 36 columns (listed above) but with the API we get a total of 41 columns. Following are the columns that are present in the CSV data but not in the API data: New Georeferenced Column. Following are the columns that are present in the API data but not in the CSV data: :@computed_region_92fq_4b7q :@computed_region_yeji_bk3q :@computed_region_efsh_h5xi geocoded_column :@computed_region_sbqj_enih :@computed_region_f5dn_yrer 2.2.4 Updates This dataset was first made public on 11/1/2018. It is updated quarterly. It appears that the metadata is updated more frequently but it is not clear what changes are incorporated as there could be several updates made in Oct 2022 but the data will only contain records up to the prior month end of Sept 2022. 2.2.5 Expected Challenges The data does not have many continuous variables. We will have to derive one based on counts and may need to supplement with other data to obtain others (ex. average cost/insurance per type of crime). There are longitude and latitude fields which we would like to utilize but have not identified an R package to process and visualize.

NYC Open Data (NYC Office of Technology and Innovation (OTI)) in conjunction with New York City Police Department (NYPD) makes public safety data available for anyone online. In particular they publish Complaint Data which contains felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to the NYPD from 2006 till present.

As of the last update on October 19, 2022, the YTD Dataset contains 397K rows and 36 columns. A data dictionary is provided by NYC Open Data at the link above. 3.1.1 Content “Complaint data” is a mixed set of records because it contains crimes (ex. robbery, rape, assault), parking violations, complaints of harassment, reports of abandoned animals, and more. In this script, we investigate, clean, and filter the data so that we can explor and answer our research questions. As the link above indicates, there are two sets of data containing distinct records. A year-to-date dataset from 1/1/2022 to 9/30/2022 and a historic dataset containing records from 1/1/2006 to 12/31/2021. We are only using the the year-to-date data but can incorporate historic records in a future iteration of the analysis. The following is a list of column names and their description. Not all fields are used for the analysis and some contain mostly blank values as we will show. As you may notice, most of the data is categorical but we will derive continuous variables through data and location fields.

Given that the CSV for YTD data is not too large (140MB), it seems the easiest to work with. CSV is a format we are most familiar with and one that R handles well.

It is updated quarterly. It appears that the metadata is updated more frequently but it is not clear what changes are incorporated as there could be several updates made in Oct 2022 but the data will only contain records up to the prior month end of Sept 2022. 3.2 Data Transformation and Cleaning This .Rmd file contains the following sections: Data Loading: To show data was ingested into the environment Bucketing: To combine values in a derived field for simplifying graphs Date Transformations: To make strings into dates and extract time information Derived Geo Fields: To calculate distances between points -Derive Other Fields: To derived other fields and perform minor cleaning operations We then filter our data frame to relevant records, and then select key fields for ease-of-use. “Relevant” records are defined by time frame and crime category explained more below. There is also a section at the end on missing data. 3.2.1 Data Loading We ingest the CSV data and must re-cast a data type for one column. 3.2.2 Bucket Crime Types This code chunk creates a new field to simplify the crime category to reduce the number of unique values for visualization purposes. We cut down from over 60 values to 5 and will show more in the Results chapter. Note: there are 5 values with missing Offense category. Since they have valid PD_CD (Crime ID) and PD_DESC, we can impute these values from other columns with the same PD_CD. -Two values are for obscenity - 594 PD_CD (categorized as sex crimes) -One values for crime pos weap - 797 PD_CD (categorized as major violent crimes/dangerous weapons) -One value for “place false bomb” - 648 PD_CD (categorized as other) -One value for “noise” - 872 PD_CD (categorized as other) 3.2.3 Date/Time Transformation Per the data dictionary, there is both a “from_date” and a “to_date” when the exact time is unknown. There is also a “report date” for when the crime was reported. Using these fields in conjunction, we can derive a new clean field that is the assumed date of the incident. Assumptions: When there is a range, we will use the “from” date only because is populated well and will on average approximate the frequency of crime over time; when from_date is null, we will use the report_date (does not occur often, see Missing Data Analysis below). 3.2.4 Geo-Location Fields This section uses a new package, geosphere, to calcluate the distance between two points in Lat/Long format. Here we are finding the distance from each crime to the center of the main Columbia campus for use later. 3.2.5 Other Derivations In this section, we add additional fields for more classification (explained more in the Results section), reclassify “null” to Unknown in specific instances, shorten values for ease-of-use, and combine information from several premise columns into one to simplify category values. 3.3 Filter Table for Relevance The raw data only contains crimes that were reported in 2022 even if they took place earlier. As we will show below, this create a bias in the time series and this section creates a new data frame to filter out old records (as defined by derived field above; before 1/1/2022). We also filter for only “relevant” crimes - i.e. excluding parking violations, noise compliants (those in the “Other” category) From this we see that there is a large drop off in historic reports. This make sense as it is more likely that someone would report a crime in the same year that it occurs. Although NYPD allows people to report crimes that occurred in 2020, there will be much fewer of them reported in 2022. If we wanted to use data prior to 2022 we should include the old crime reports for prior years. Also there are some quality issues with historic data as we see very old crimes (year 1500) which indicate some human error or a record-keeping issue. After filtering the data, we have a cleaner data frame and more sensical results as we will show in the next chapter. Overall, there are not many records that are excluded (from 396,978 to 364,298). 3.4 Select and Rename Columns This section simply chooses fields that are used in our analysis to simplify and reduce the overall size of the working data frame. We also make some character fields factors and order them by frequency. 3.5 Missing Value Analysis First let us look at the raw data to see what things look like originally. We can categorize nulls as real (i.e. true NA) vs “artificial” (i.e. the word “null” in the raw data or similar). Then we can show which fields and what percent of each (out of the 300k rows) may have an issue. ## # A tibble: 23 × 5 ## field Real_Null Artificial_Null Total Percent ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 HADEVELOPT 0 395756 395756 99.7 ## 2 PARKS_NM 0 394295 394295 99.3 ## 3 STATION_NAME 0 388677 388677 97.9 ## 4 TRANSIT_DISTRICT 388677 0 388677 97.9 ## 5 HOUSING_PSA 371512 0 371512 93.6 ## 6 Inside_Outside 66081 0 66081 16.6 ## 7 LOC_OF_OCCUR_DESC 66081 0 66081 16.6 ## 8 CMPLNT_TO_DT 29393 0 29393 7.4 ## 9 CMPLNT_TO_TM 0 29276 29276 7.37 ## 10 BORO_NM 657 0 657 0.17 ## 11 Borough_short 657 0 657 0.17 ## 12 PREM_TYP_DESC 0 476 476 0.12 ## 13 PD_CD 440 0 440 0.11 ## 14 PD_DESC 0 440 440 0.11 ## 15 ADDR_PCT_CD 20 0 20 0.01 ## 16 Lat_Lon 9 0 9 0 ## 17 Latitude 9 0 9 0 ## 18 Longitude 9 0 9 0 ## 19 New Georeferenced Column 9 0 9 0 ## 20 X_COORD_CD 9 0 9 0 ## 21 Y_COORD_CD 9 0 9 0 ## 22 OFNS_DESC 0 5 5 0 ## 23 PATROL_BORO 0 2 2 0 So we see we have mostly missing data for 5 fields. Location and its derived field is also missing a good portion which is likely due to masking for privacy reasons per the data source notes found at the NY Open Data Link. Let us look at missing patterns now: Raw Data, All Columns: Raw Data, All Columns (Except Transit_District and Housing_PSA): These charts are hard to read given the number of columns but it shows that most data is actually populated very well as we saw above. There are two problem fields causing all of the real nulls but we can re-graph this without those and see that complete cases are at the top. However, this is still not accurate because there are string values in the data that say “(null)” or “Unknown” which would appear as populated. In any case, we do not need to clean and evaluate all columns, so let us work off of the new, filtered dataset we created in a prior section (see below). Side Note: We initially noticed the Complaint_Num was null often but this was due to it containing alphanumeric characters and R loading it as a number only. It has been corrected and serves as a primary key for the data frame. The filtered data (relevant columns and rows only) is populated very well and this dataset accounts for improperly coded values where “(null)” will appear as NA properly. We have re-coded some values to “Unknown” as that value appears in the raw data is is reasonable (e.g. if the suspect was not found, we have no information on them and can say Unknown). We see there are a few blanks for Borough and lat/long and thus the related derived field, but otherwise we have a good data frame to use in the next chapter. 3.6 Interactive Component Datasets The following code is used to create CSV files for use in the interactive component. Data is pre-filtered to keep the overall size small and manageable when plotting lots of points. This speeds up the time when users interact in that chapter. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Crime Category and Demographic Analysis 4.2 Time Series Analysis 4.3 Location Analysis", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Crime Category and Demographic Analysis We start our analysis of crime types by investigating what types of crimes occur in what frequencies. We bucketed the numerous crimes from the raw data into logical categories in the last chaptuer. Note that in the pre-processing stage, we removed a small “Other” category of parking violations and noise complaints. Here we can see the crime incident that has happened the most frequently is “Petit Larceny”, a form of larceny in which the value of the property taken is generally less than $50. We also observe that theft or burglary related crimes are the most common by far. This category is followed by sex crimes, violent crimes, and fraud/gambling related crimes all of which are relatively close in number. The lowest category by far is drug and alcohol related crimes, perhaps because the policing of these crimes has been relaxed over the last few years. 4.1.1 Crime by Borough When one decides to attend Columbia University, one may ask themselves which borough should they live in depending on the relative safety of living in each borough. Therefore, following are the plots of count of total crimes and different types of crimes by the boroughs. From these graphs, we note that with respect to overall crime, Brooklyn has the most crime followed by Manhattan. Secondly, it’s interesting to see that while Brooklyn has more crime of type “SEX CRIMES”, “MAJOR VIOLENT CRIMES”, AND “FRAUD/GAMBLING AND MISC” compared to Manhattan while Manhattan has more crime of type “THEFT OR BURGLARY” and “DRUG AND ALCOHOL RELATED” compared to Brooklyn. Let us now take a look at other variables in the dataset. After some trial and error, the following yields some insights (looking at only crimes against individuals): We see here that more crime occurs inside compared to outside (which aligns with the fact most crime is larceny/theft). What is interesting there does not seem to be a difference between age groups and boroughs and premise as the divisions are mostly even. Even accounting for uneven age groups in the raw data, it still seems like 25-44 is the largest category. 4.1.2 Race We can dig further into demographics by looking into the race and gender of both the suspects and victims. Note - this is simply exploratory analysis of data that has been reported and categorized by the NYPD and care should be taken for any extrapolation that may be made. Let us begin by diving into trends between the race of the suspects and victims. While there is a lot of null/unknown data, we would like to explore patterns between the race of the suspect and victim. We see from the bar charts that most of the victims are Black and also that most of the suspects are Black. Logically, the intersection of these two fields is also the highest which is made evident in the heatmap. While this graph has its merits, demographically we know that there are much fewer people of say American Indian race than Black. It may also be worth looking at the proportion per suspect race in each horizontal victim race band to account for uneven data classes. 4.1.3 Gender Next, lets do a gender focused analysis. We see that most of the victims are female and most of the suspects are male although there is a large unknown category. It is concerning but would fit with the historical paradigm that most of the crime seems to be committed by men towards women. 4.2 Time Series Analysis Per pre-processing, we are focusing on incidents reported in 2022. We can look at the overall trend during the year as of the publish date, after Q3 2022. The overall trend is dominated by theft crimes since the volume is largest. It does seem like there is a hump over summer which may align to more human activity and thus more crime. Uniquely, there is a dip for drug crimes in the summer. 4.2.1 Day of Week Let’s now look at some other time related charts. There are a few interesting trends here. For one, theft appears to be lower on weekends whereas violent crimes are the opposite. We also see that fraud/gambling ramps up over the week and peaks on Fridays. Sex crimes are highest on Wednesdays surprisingly. 4.2.2 Time of Day Let’s also look at the time of the day: The raw data is rounded to the nearest minute but there is likely binning happening with time reported on the nearest hour. There appears to be a peak at 12:00pm (12 of 24) which is likely a data quality issue in that reports may default to that time when not specified exactly. This also happens as 12:00am (0 of 24) though it is harder to see due to how the ridge plot extrapolates at the boundary. That said, this graph shows that crimes seems to peak at night around 6pm. But is this related to individual crimes and in/around parks? From prior charts, we know that the number of crimes is skewed toward those occurring in “Inside”. This does not represent the magnitude but we can see that for individuals, parks are more ‘dangerous’ at night - more so than other locations. However, it is somewhat comforting to know that this starts to drop off quickly after about 7-8pm. 4.3 Location Analysis 4.3.1 Spatial Distribution Around Columbia Since a component of our research is to analyze how crime is spread out around Columbia University, a visual analysis of spatial distribution of all crime around Columbia is useful. The following is a map centered around Columbia University (CU) that shows where crime is distributed. The above map is useful to see how geographical location of a crime is coded in the dataset - for example, all crimes happening on a particular street (or residences on a particular street) between two avenues is assigned to the lat-long coordinates of the center of that street (See W 111th St to W 124th St for instance). Another thing this shows is around which subway station there is more crime. For example, out of the 2 125th st stations, the one on the right has noticeably more crime concentrated around it than the one on the left. Note that the way data is recorded, all crimes that happen inside a subway station are coded to the location of the subway station. So this result could also mean that one station is safer than the other. This map could also be used to plan one’s route to and from Columbia depending if safety is a concern. For example, one could see which streets and avenues have less crime concentrated on them and so could indicate which routes are generally safer to travel on. Stay tuned for our interactive component that makes it easier for you to zoom in and out while planning your route! 4.3.2 Spatial Distribution Around Columbia by Crime Category Following maps show the spatial distribution of crime around Columbia University by crime categories. The above maps clearly show that the most prevalent kind of crime around Columbia University is “THEFT OR BURGLARY” and “DRUG AND ALCOHOL RELATED” crimes are the least prevalent. Another interesting pattern to note is that for the categories “SEX CRIMES”, “FRAUD/GAMBLING AND MISC”, and “MAJOR VIOLENT CRIMES”, the crime is concentrated most around 125th st. 4.3.3 Increasing Radius from Columbia The following histogram was produced to check how the crime frequency increases with increasing radius away from school. This graph shows that within each 100m radius (up to 2000m away from Columbia), the crime frequency increases. The explanation is that because the increase in area considered within each 100m bin increases polynomially (with the power of 2), it’s only natural that we see more crimes in buckets farther away from Columbia than those closer to columbia because the area considered within each bucket increases more than linearly. It is still interesting to note however that for some buckets the crime frequency goes down even though the area considered goes up. The next plots further investigate this issue using the concept of density of crime. 4.3.4 Cumulative Crime Near CU The previous plot motivated us to try to confirm whether the crime frequency follows a quadratic relationship with respect to radius from Columbia University. Note that this would imply that crime scales linearly with the area considered. Note that the curve roughly follows the shape of the quadratic curve confirming that the crime does increase linearly with area and quadratically with the radius considered. So then, what explains the decline in crime frequency observed in some of the buckets in the previous histogram? (For instance, the bucket that shows the crime frequency to drop between 1100m and 1200m as compared to the bucket that shows the crime frequency within 1000m and 1100m). We further explore this issue in our next plots. 4.3.5 Crime Density Since in the earlier histogram we saw that within some buckets the crime count was decreasing, we wanted to see how the density of crime changes as move away from Columbia generally and also specifically as we move from a bucket of 100m radius to the next bucket of the incremental 100m radius. Note that the cumulative density plot shows that crime is less dense within 750m of Columbia after which it becomes more dense. Potential explanations are that there could be extra policing around the campus area, or an increase in crime density due to an increase in population density as we move beyond 750m from Columbia. The incremental density plot shows the increase (or decrease) in density as we move from a bucket of 100m to radius to the bucket of next 100m radius around Columbia. Note that this graph also shows what the earlier histogram showed, i.e., for some buckets the density of crime goes down. 4.3.6 Deeper Dive of Crime Density To finally see why we see buckets of incremental 100m radius away from Columbia with decreasing density of crime, we decided to plot these buckets visually on a google map of the area around Columbia overlapped with the spatial density of crime. We speculate that we see up and down jumps in incremental crime density due to the following reasons: While we increase the area in a circular fashion as we move away from Columbia, the lat/long coordinates of crime are recorded with the grid structure of Manhattan in mind. Therefore, some incremental radius/area buckets circles end up having way less crime reported if they contain parts of a park in them (since the crimes within parks are reported as happening on the streets outside the parks). Another reason is that many crimes are just reported to the center of the streets (as discussed in the spatial distribution map earlier). What ends up happening is that some incremental radius/area buckets end up including a straight line of all these concentrated crimes which lead to their crime density shooting up- see for example the area between the third last and the second last circle that ends up having majority of the crimes reported on streets W 112th to W 120th. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive Component 5.1 Interactive Map of Crime Around Columbia 5.2 Future Work", " Chapter 5 Interactive Component The following map contains a list of crimes near Columbia (within 1km). Each dot indicates a reported crime (data filtered per the steps described in the “Data” chapter). The motivation for this component is to allow a user to select features through a series of buttons and view what crime statistics look like geographically. Try playing with the filters to adjust the amount of reported crime. As shown the previous chapter, more crime occurs at night and when the victim is female. This chapter uses a special package, ggmap, cited below: D. Kahle and H. Wickham. ggmap: Spatial Visualization with ggplot2. The R Journal, 5(1), 144-161.

Please be patient while the data renders. Victim Gender: All Male Female Time of Day: All Day (6am-6pm) Night (6pm-6am) All Data Points (within 1km): 5.2 Future Work There are several changes we have considered: 1.The graph is usable but the alpha-blending on the points does not entirely capture the magnitude of the crime. We were thinking to add an additional component to show total crime counts. 2. There are only limited filters enabled right now but adding more could help a user hone down to a target subset that is customized for them. 3. We had hoped to allow users to select both a “from” and “to” destination but found that was hard to execute and would require some design thinking on how to implement without a user having to type in specific latitude and longitude. 4. We also would like to speed up the efficiency of the program by optimizing how the map draws data points around a location - perhaps down-sampling the data could help and we could expand beyond 1km. 5. We also would like to clean up some of the warnings produced by the code and ggmap as well as catch potential errors that could be thrown. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion 6.1 Limitations and Future Work", " Chapter 6 Conclusion Disclaimer: The following conclusions expand on findings from the earlier chapters but are still limited to the dataset used in this project. Additional data and analysis are required to fully understand trends and safety in NYC. We started this project to understand a bit more about crime in NYC and safety (broadly defined) around Columbia. There are limitations with the data and analysis defined more in the section below, but overall this was an interesting exercise and can help inform decisions we make everyday. We found that larceny and theft is the most commonly reported crime. This holds true for Manhattan and all boroughs, but violent crime and sex crimes are higher in Brooklyn and the Bronx than in Manhattan. Most crime appears to take place indoors which coincides with the large amount of theft. Many reported crimes do not have individual information populated but for the ones that do, it appears that victims are black or female most often. Surprisingly, there does not seem to be a large difference in victim ages across locations with the “&lt;18” years old category being smallest everywhere. Overall summer months appear to be more active for crime. Crime categories change with different days of the week where theft appears to be lower on weekends whereas violent crimes are the opposite. The time of day also reasonably affects the amount of crime. It seems most crime occurs at 5:00pm with with crime at parks peaking around 8:00pm and a more even distribution in the subway throughout a day. Columbia University, west of Morningside park, appears relatively safe but there are several limitation to conclude this. For one, there is a level of binning happening with reported locations being imprecise. Also, locations are sometimes listed at the nearest NYPD precinct so there is a skew near 123rd St and Fredrick Douglas Blvd. Additionally, the data depends on reported crime to the NYPD and it is possible that CU police use a different system. 6.1 Limitations and Future Work In addition to some of the limits listed above, we would like to mention that care should be taken when using crime statistics to evaluate risk. A simple example relates to parks at nights. There are very few people who may walk through a park at night and thus even if 100% of people get mugged, the total number of reports of crime will be small. It would help to enhance the data to integrate overall movement or human activity statistics to be able to see proportions of crime vs no crime. While we are able to filter reports to relevant crimes for this analysis, some crime is not reported at all. For example, drug use can be consider a mala prohibita offense meaning no complaint is filed. So this dataset would not be representative of the true rate of drug-related crime without additional info from justice department forms and filings. The data in this project only contained 3 quarters of data and integrating historical years may show new and interesting trends. We also only scratched the surface of data cleansing. In terms of analysis, we could enhance the interactive component to be more of a dashboard with additional charts and filters. And we could make the distance analysis more robust by allowing users to select a location rather than hard-coding to Columbia.
