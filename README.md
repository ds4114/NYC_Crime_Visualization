## Visualization of Nearby NYC Crime Statistics

The rendered R bookdown can found at the following link: https://ds4114.github.io/NYC_Crime_Visualization/

The motivation for this project spawned from practical questions related to navigating NYC on and off campus. Broadly, is there is a walking path home that exhibits the least risk? How does this change with time of day? Are parks really as dangerous as portrayed? The focus of this code is to analyze NYPD crime and complaint data around Columbia during the school year. 

Data in this project comes from NYC Open Data (NYC Office of Technology and Innovation (OTI)) in conjunction with New York City Police Department (NYPD). Public safety data (Complaint Data) contains felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to the NYPD from 2006 till present and is available: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Current-Year-To-Date-/5uac-w243
